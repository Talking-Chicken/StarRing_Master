        Lacey: "Ma'am, I'm really sorry, but I truly cannot allow anyone to do this in the store."
        Rita: "Do you understand how important this is for my research? Just one night of observation and I could gather crucial data."

        Lacey: "I understand that your school project is important to you, but I must consider the safety and comfort of all our customers."
        Rita: "Do you really think a small tent could threaten anyone's 'safety and comfort'?"
        Rita: "And don't you dare equate my research with those childish school projects!"
        Lacey: "Honestly, just the idea of camping out in a convenience store with a tent is outlandish enough. And did you bring any other suspicious items besides the tent?"
        Lacey: "I must remind you again, we have rules and regulations in our store, and your actions are already affecting other customers."
        Rita: "Rules and regulations? Some of the products you sell here are more dangerous than what I'm doing. Like, let me think, oh yes! That Mirin-flavored soda that two out of three people complain about after drinking!"
        Lacey: "Whatâ€™s wrong with the Mirin flavor? Everyone has different tastes. Besides, that's more like a... promotional product specially made by the company..."
        Amo: "Ah, it seems senior is wavering."
        Lacey: "Think about it, at least one out of those three people doesn't complain. Maybe it's a marketing strategy to gain attention with such controversial products."
        Amo: "Seems like you're admitting our products have some issues."
        Rabbit: "Indeed, an admission."
        Lacey: "Regardless, those products have passed safety inspections, which is a different matter from you spending the night here. And it's unreasonable for a high school student to stay out at night. What if your parents hold us responsible?"
        Rita: "My father has nothing to do with this. And how many times do I have to tell you how critical my research is! It could redefine our understanding of the world."
        Lacey: "If 'redefining the world' means I might lose my job, that's quite a difficult choice for me."
        Lacey: "Anyway, I hope you read that sign again. As long as the 'No Camping' sign is up in the store, you can't set up your tent here."

        Rita: "What kind of convenience store even has a 'No Camping' sign?"
        Lacey: "The kind that gets unusual customers wanting to camp out.
