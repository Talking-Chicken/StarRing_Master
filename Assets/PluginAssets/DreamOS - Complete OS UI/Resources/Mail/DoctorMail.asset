  mailContent: "Hi Eddie,\r\n\r\nI attempted to call the phone number that we have
    on file for you, but the call went to voicemail which was not set up, so I was
    unable to leave a message. It\u2019s been a while since your last check-up. I
    would like to discuss your appointment schedule and make some additional recommendations.\r\n\r\nPlease
    call the clinic or reply to this email to let us know your preferred date and
    time for the next appointment. I am available from Monday to Thursday of this
    week from 8 am-6 pm.\r\n\r\nI would also like to remind you that your prescription
    is crucial for your health. Please make sure to take them regularly.\r\n\r\nI
    look forward to seeing you again soon. \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nDr.Doe\r"
