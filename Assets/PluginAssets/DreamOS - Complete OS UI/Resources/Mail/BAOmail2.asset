  mailContent: "Dear Citizens,\r\n\r\nThe bureau made an unfortunate mistake in the
    last email. The actual impacts of the meteors were much milder than we initially
    calculated. After multiple reassessments, we regret to inform you that the apocalypse
    is officially canceled.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for any inconvenience our
    previous email may have caused. The bureau will improve the observatories for
    more accurate apocalypse forecasts. If you have any questions or concerns, please
    contact us through mail. We will process all requests in 14-28 business days.\r\n\r\nWe
    know it\u2019s a bummer, but at least your favorite show may get a new season
    now. If you followed our recommendations from the previous email and are now
    facing unforeseen consequences \u2013 well, there is always another apocalypse.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nApocalypse
    Coordination Bureau\r"
