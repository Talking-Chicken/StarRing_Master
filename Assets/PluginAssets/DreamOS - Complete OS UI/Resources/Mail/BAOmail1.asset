  mailContent: "We hope you have enjoyed your day because the content of this email
    will be somewhat concerning. We, the Bureau of Apocalypse Observation,  regret
    to inform you that the apocalypse is officially here.\r\n\r\nOur global network
    of observatories detected a cluster of meteors on a collision course with Earth.
    While the exact time and locations of the impacts are still under analysis, we
    recommend these steps to prepare for potential strikes:\r\n\r\n1. Stay Calm\n\n2.
    Prepare Supplies: Ensure your emergency supplies, including food, water, medical
    kits, and communication devices, are readily available. If you need to purchase
    food, please visit our sponsor\u2019s website: www.cannedfoodtycoon.com\r\n\r\n3.
    Support Each Other: Communicate with your family and friends to ensure they take
    appropriate measures. You may also connect with your hated ones and tell them
    how much you hate them while you still can.\r\n\r\n4. Catch Up on Your Favorite
    Shows: Apocalypse sucks, but at least you still have some time to catch up on
    the shows you always wanted to watch. Although, some of your favorite shows won\u2019t
    ever get a new season.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to provide updates as more information
    becomes available. We remain committed to doing everything possible to salvage
    the impending catastrophe. If all measures fail, we advise you to sit back, relax,
    and enjoy a once-in-a-lifetime meteor shower.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nBureau of
    Apocalypse Observation\r\n"
