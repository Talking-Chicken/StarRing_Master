  mailContent: "Dear Citizens,\r\n\r\nWe hope this email finds you well, although
    the gravity of its content is somewhat concerning. We, the Bureau of Apocalypse
    Observation,  regret to inform you that the apocalypse is officially here.\r\n\r\nIn
    recent days, our global network of observatories has detected a cluster of meteors
    on a collision course with Earth. While the exact timing and locations of the
    impacts are still under analysis, we are confident that it will strike multiple
    places across the globe. We recommend these steps to prepare for the potential
    end of the world:\r\n\r\n1. Remain Calm: While the situation is undoubtedly distressing,
    it is essential to remain calm and rational.\r\n\r\n2. Prepare Supplies: Ensure
    your emergency supplies, including food, water, medical kits, and communication
    devices, are readily available and up to date. We recommend a well-balanced,
    canned food-based diet. If you need to purchase food, please visit our sponsor\u2019s
    website: www.cannedfoodtycoon.com\r\n\r\n3. Connect with Loved Ones: Communicate
    with your family and friends to ensure they are taking appropriate measures.
    Share information and resources to support one another during this crisis. [Bonus:
    You may also connect with your hated ones and let them know how much you hate
    them while you still can.]\r\n\r\n4. Catch Up on Your Favorite Shows: Apocalypse
    sucks, but at least you still have some time to catch up on the shows you always
    wanted to watch. Although, on the other hand, some of your favorite shows won\u2019t
    ever get a new season.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to provide updates as more information
    becomes available. We remain committed to doing everything in our power to mitigate
    the impending catastrophe. If all measures fail, we advise you to sit back, relax,
    and enjoy a once-in-a-lifetime meteor shower.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nBureau of
    Apocalypse Observation\r\n"
